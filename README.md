# Dreams
This is a brainstorming document and very stream of consciousness.

- Charter Boat Bookings: 
  - Launch my enterprise marketplace site for fishing and sunset sails
  - bareboat model 
  - managed crewed yachts
  - boat rental
  
- Virtual Small Groups: Basically making the idea of online small group meetings, study groups very turnkey and easily administrated. Create a platform where teachers, group hosts, and attendees can get together, share content, and do life together even if they are a world apart. The search engine research I've done shows that basically church of the highlands and saddleback dominate the space, but there really isn't a central platform. Maybe there should be? Worth a shot.


- Easter Snaps | Bible Snaps: A mobile video social platform for little encouragements or easter celebrations which can be 'gifted' to a friend securely and suitable for children / bible teachers. So - if every tik tok were tied to a bible verse and either taught or encouraged. What a way to start a morning, drink my cofee. Open my Bible tik tok and get little bite sized lessons or encouragements which would be in my feed based on my browsing history and preferences but could also be searched based on verse, chapter, topic, category, etc. So that I could have a 'cheat sheet' for my morning quiet time when I am not in the middle of a deep bible study or small group. Sometimes, I just dont have the emotional or cognitive space to be deep...
  
- Team Text: I love the headless team text twilio thing I sort of built last year. I need to go back to that and finish building it out. Maybe it can always remain a free tool. I think there are a few apps out there that function in this way targeted to the educational market. But none of the ones I've used are actually easy to use or set up the feature set that I have in mind. A parent, teacher, or coach should not have to install a new app and access it to get, send, or receive messages. To set this whole thing up it is as simple as the coach texting "new team" to xxx-xxx-xxxx. 
 
- WP Instructor Certification
  Should'nt WP have a program akin to the Adobe Certified Instructor course that certifies or qualifies a person to teach WP Users how to use WP?
    - The goal would be to create such a program, find sponsors, and offer scholarships to public school teachers that teach technology to elementary and middle school students. It is my experience from being a mom that at least in smaller more rural districts, the teachers do not know and therein cannot properly teach tech subjects - which now includes marketign, graphic design, etc
    - its not really only about school teachers. it is also about providing small agencies a way to turn-key educate thier clients to use thier websites. this is one of the biggest pain points for small agencies.
    - this is also a great growth channel for WP as a whole. If certified instructors had a turn key curriculumn for teaching an in-person course - then WP knowledge could grow grass roots through commnunity centers, churches, schools, and parks and rec. A network of workshops and classes just like yoga or anything else.

- WP Omni-Channel Funnel Optimization
    - I would like to build a plugin that would provide a way for DIY or small agencies to properly coordinate GA with WP so that journeys, funnels, and conversion opportunities are tracked and measured.
    - I am clear that there are tools out there, but it is my experience that a person needs a depth of marketing knowledge to use these tools. So even if a business owner had the knowledge to use WP, choose the right plugins, etc they quite likely would lack the marketing knowledge to use the tools they have been provided. 
    - the goal is to emulate WP SEO with the amazingly clever Red, Yellow, Green Light but instead of measuring and offerint correction advice for on-site SEO, the plugin could address concerning engagement and conversion factors to measure and improve customer experience and push towards pre-established business goals.
    - ideally I would take this farther than just onsite content measurement with Twilio and Mailgun we could include multichannel customer tracking and experience optimization. Including ways for WP Admins to establish triggers for transactional multichannel communication with leads and also measure the effectiveness of those communications.
    - these features may be included in one or more plugins that can be combined together to get the end result, but the goal is to establish the one plugin that makes customer experience measurement and optimizationa across channels turn key for the DIY small business owner.
