# Dreams
This is a brainstorming document and very stream of consciousness.

- WP Charter boat bookings for bareboat and managed yachts

- Easter Snaps | Bible Snaps

- Virtual Small Groups

- WP Omni-Channel Funnel Optimization
 so I want to build and have started to build a plugin that would provide a way for DIY or small agencies to properly coordinate GA with WP so that journeys, funnels, and conversion opportunities are tracked and measured.
 the goal is to emulate WP SEO with the amazingly clever Red, Yellow, Green Light but instead of SEO - engagement and conversion factors to measure and pass/fail content within funnels and journeys
 ideally I would take this farther than just onsite content measurement. it should include ways for WP Admins to establish triggers for transactional multichannel communication with leads and also measure the effectiveness of those communications.
 im not sure if this exists in one of the big house analytics plugins, but if it does it is not easy for someone off the street to use and understand. So for me this is all about UI and making the whole idea of Data Driven Marketing understandable and acheivable for a layperson.
  
- I love the headless team text twilio thing. I need to go back to that and finish building it out. Maybe it can always remain a free tool. 
 
- WP Instructor Certification
  Should'nt WP have a program akin to the Adobe Certified Instructor course that certifies or qualifies a person to teach WP Users how to use WP?
-- The goal would be to create such a program, find sponsors, and offer scholarships to public school teachers that teach technology to elementary and middle school students. It is my experience from being a mom that at least in smaller more rural districts, the teachers do not know and therein cannot properly teach tech subjects - which now includes marketign, graphic design, etc
-- its not really only about school teachers. it is also about providing small agencies a way to turn-key educate thier clients to use thier websites. this is one of the biggest pain points for small agencies.
-- this is also a great growth channel for WP as a whole. If certified instructors had a turn key curriculumn for teaching an in-person course - then WP knowledge could grow grass roots through commnunity centers, churches, schools, and parks and rec. A network of workshops and classes just like yoga or anything else.
