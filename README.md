# Dreams

1. WP Omni-Channel Funnel Optimization
 so I want to build and have started to build a plugin that would provide a way for DIY or small agencies to properly coordinate GA with WP so that journeys, funnels, and conversion opportunities are tracked and measured.
 the goal is to emulate WP SEO with the amazingly clever Red, Yellow, Green Light but instead of SEO - engagement and conversion factors to measure and pass/fail content within funnels and journeys
 ideally I would take this farther than just onsite content measurement. it should include ways for WP Admins to establish triggers for transactional multichannel communication with leads and also measure the effectiveness of those communications.
 im not sure if this exists in one of the big house analytics plugins, but if it does it is not easy for someone off the street to use and understand. So for me this is all about UI and making the whole idea of Data Driven Marketing understandable and acheivable for a layperson.
 
 2. WP Charter boat bookings for bareboat and managed yachts
 
 3. I love my team text thing. I need to go back to that and build it out
 
 4. 
 
 5. WP Instrustor Certification
  should'nt WP have a program akin to the Adobe Certified Instructor course that certifies or qualifies a person to teach WP Users how to use WP?
  The goal would be to create such a program, find sponsors, and offer scholarships to public school teachers that teach technology to elementary and middle school students. It is my experience from being a mom that at least in smaller more rural districts, the teachers do not know and therein cannot properly teach tech subjects - which now includes marketign, graphic design, etc
  
  6. WP Automattic Website Builder
   I get it that WordPress.com is supposed to be, but it doesnt work as intuitively as Wix and i think a new soution could co-exist for self-hosted wordpress.
   Think a logic tree starting from the essential question - what do you want to do with your website which funnels a user into the lets say top 20 to start functions a website needs to take. Configures a suitable theme and bundle of plugins. Adds sample content in each post type. Then uses functionality like the duplicator plugin to spit out an installer file and an archive file for the user which can then be remotely installed on the server via SSH. 
   Gutenberg makes this possible where it never really was before in WP. Because the user can go into each of the sample pages and using the gutenberg wysiwyg transform the content into thier own. 
   I love what carike showed me with the color palette site...https://www.colorbook.io/colorschemes there could be a path on the 'website wizard' where they can choose a color palette.
   This may be totally unneccesary and totally cannibalize WordPress.com but it seems to me that with the 10's of 1000's of plugins on the .org repository WP has the opportunity to finely tune a site configuration, design, and functionality better than Wix. If you give people more exactly what they want - they will like you better...okay this may be a stupid idea
