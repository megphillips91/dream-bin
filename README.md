# Dreams
This is a brainstorming document and very stream of consciousness.

- WP Charter boat bookings for bareboat and managed yachts

- Easter Snaps | Bible Snaps

- Virtual Small Groups
  
- I love the headless team text twilio thing. I need to go back to that and finish building it out. Maybe it can always remain a free tool. 
 
- WP Instructor Certification
  Should'nt WP have a program akin to the Adobe Certified Instructor course that certifies or qualifies a person to teach WP Users how to use WP?
    - The goal would be to create such a program, find sponsors, and offer scholarships to public school teachers that teach technology to elementary and middle school students. It is my experience from being a mom that at least in smaller more rural districts, the teachers do not know and therein cannot properly teach tech subjects - which now includes marketign, graphic design, etc
    - its not really only about school teachers. it is also about providing small agencies a way to turn-key educate thier clients to use thier websites. this is one of the biggest pain points for small agencies.
    - this is also a great growth channel for WP as a whole. If certified instructors had a turn key curriculumn for teaching an in-person course - then WP knowledge could grow grass roots through commnunity centers, churches, schools, and parks and rec. A network of workshops and classes just like yoga or anything else.

- WP Omni-Channel Funnel Optimization
    - I would like to build a plugin that would provide a way for DIY or small agencies to properly coordinate GA with WP so that journeys, funnels, and conversion opportunities are tracked and measured.
    - I am clear that there are tools out there, but it is my experience that a person needs a depth of marketing knowledge to use these tools. So even if a business owner had the knowledge to use WP, choose the right plugins, etc they quite likely would lack the marketing knowledge to use the tools they have been provided. 
    - the goal is to emulate WP SEO with the amazingly clever Red, Yellow, Green Light but instead of measuring and offerint correction advice for on-site SEO, the plugin could address concerning engagement and conversion factors to measure and improve customer experience and push towards pre-established business goals.
    - ideally I would take this farther than just onsite content measurement with Twilio and Mailgun we could include multichannel customer tracking and experience optimization. Including ways for WP Admins to establish triggers for transactional multichannel communication with leads and also measure the effectiveness of those communications.
    - these features may be included in one or more plugins that can be combined together to get the end result, but the goal is to establish the one plugin that makes customer experience measurement and optimizationa across channels turn key for the DIY small business owner.
